# Fine Grained Sentiment Analysis

This is a quick analysis of 30k multilingual customer reviews, with the goal of reporting multi-class sentiment scores on a scale of 1-5 'star' ratings.

A BERT LLM that has been trained on multilingual customer review data base is leveraged from the HuggingFace library to achieve this.

# Instillation

```
python3.7 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# TODO: 

* Running in batch mode
* Fine tuning
* Run a translation model to translate reviews into most heavily used language in the bert training data
  * Test on other Python versions
* Only tested in python3.7
* Develop alternative method?
