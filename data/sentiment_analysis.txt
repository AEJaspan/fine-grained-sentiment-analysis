This task is designed as a starting point for a technical discussion. You're
not required to select the most sophisticated model or delve too deeply into
the analysis. Our primary interest lies in understanding your thought process
rather than the model's peak performance. We recommend not investing an
excessive amount of time on it, a concise script or notebook is enough.


Task details:

1. Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis: Using the supplied dataset, perform a
sentiment analysis with the following categories - Very Negative, Negative,
Neutral, Positive, Very Positive. The target value is the "score" column. Note:
The "vote" column indicates the number of users who found the review helpful.
The "review_summary" and "review" columns are self-explanatory. You're free to
employ any library you're comfortable with.

2. Discussion: Propose a list of points you think should be highlighted in our
discussion about your solution and thought process (e.g. steps, model choice,
alternative approaches...).
